# **Shadow Slayer**

Shadow Slayer is an action-packed stealth game inspired by the popular mobile game **Hunter Assassin**, featuring advanced **State Machines** to manage dynamic enemy AI. Players face unique enemy behaviors and strategies, making for an immersive and challenging experience.

This project demonstrates the power of the **State Design Pattern** and **State Machines** in implementing scalable and dynamic enemy AI. Enemies exhibit a variety of behaviors, such as patrolling, chasing, shooting, and teleporting, which adapt based on game events like player actions.

## **Features**

- **State Machines for Enemy AI**:
  - Enemies dynamically switch between states like **Idle**, **Patrolling**, **Chasing**, and **Shooting**.
  - Unique enemy types (e.g., One Punch Man, Clone Man, Hitman) with distinct behaviors.

- **Stealth Gameplay**:
  - Players strategically navigate levels to avoid detection and eliminate enemies.

- **Scalable and Modular Architecture**:
  - Built with **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** and **Service Locator** patterns.
  - Easy integration of new enemies, states, and player abilities.

- **Customizable Levels**:
  - Configure levels, enemies, and AI behaviors using **Scriptable Objects**.

- **Dynamic UI**:
  - Interactive UI for level selection, gameplay, and post-game results.
